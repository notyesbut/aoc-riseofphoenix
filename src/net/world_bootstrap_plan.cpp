//  The default Road A bootstrap plan — describes the first 100 captured
//  packets in terms of how WorldBootstrapEmitter should reproduce each.
//
//  ── Plan classification (per docs/native-bootstrap-sequence.md and
//     docs/BOOTSTRAP-STATIC-VS-DYNAMIC.md) ──
//
//  pkt #0       NativePc0      AoC opcode 3 — already handled by BootstrapEmitter
//  pkt #1       Skip           server-frame-time keepalive
//  pkt #2       Splice         NMT_Welcome re-emit (the live NMT handler
//                              already sent NMT_Welcome during handshake;
//                              we splice this re-emit just to match the
//                              captured stream's chSeq advancement)
//  pkts #3-#21  Skip           19 sentinel keepalives (21B bb=1 each)
//  pkt #22      NativePc22     PC ActorOpen — PcEmitter (with minted GUID)
//                              + initial Name property update
//  pkts #23-#77 Splice         PC continuation tail + ch=85 GUIDExports +
//                              ch=2 GUIDExport + various other actor opens
//  pkt #78      NativePawn78   Pawn ActorOpen — PawnEmitter (currently
//                              splices captured pkt#78 bytes; will be
//                              replaced with native ActorBuilder later)
//  pkts #79-#99 Splice         Initial PlayerState replication tick + NPC
//                              spawns + initial property values (HP/MP/etc.)
//
//  Pacing: 15 ms between most packets (matches captured cadence); 100 ms
//  before the PC ActorOpen so the client processes early GUIDExports first.
//
//  ── How to upgrade entries to native ──
//  1. Add a new EmissionMode for the packet (e.g. NativePcTail23)
//  2. Add a dispatch case in WorldBootstrapEmitter::dispatch_one
//  3. Flip this row's mode here
//  4. Test (byte-identity ideally; in-game otherwise)
// ============================================================================
#include "net/world_bootstrap_emitter.h"

// ── OPTION C — minimal plan for divergence-isolation test (2026-04-27) ──
//
// When 1, strips most post-PC-chain rows (47-77 and 79+) so the only
// captured packets emitted are: pkt#0 (opcode 3), pkt#2 (NMT_Welcome),
// pkt#22-46 (the full multi-fragment PC ActorOpen chain), pkt#78 (Pawn
// ActorOpen via PawnEmitter).  Goal: prove or disprove that the
// loading-screen loop is caused by post-spawn world replication
// divergence (captured session opens different streamed sublevels than
// our live session, since the captured player spawned in a different
// world tile).
//
// Expected outcomes:
//   * World renders empty + character visible at origin
//     → divergence is the blocker; next step is a native
//       ServerUpdateLevelVisibility responder (Option B).
//   * Still loading-screen loop with a different failure signature
//     → client expects a specific post-spawn property tick (HP, name,
//       team, etc.); add a single targeted Splice row back and retest.
//   * Disconnect shortly after pkt#78
//     → channel stream starvation; Maintain loop must keep
//       channels alive after Pawn open.
//
// Flip back to 0 to restore the full ~500-packet plan.

    // Originally: Splice the captured ClientRestart RPC.  Audit revealed:
    //   1. The captured packet's bunches don't decode cleanly with our
    //      parser (parser sees ch=15247 garbage at file's bsb=152).  The
    //      client may receive it but get nothing useful.
    //   2. Even if it decoded, its Pawn NetGUID was for the original
    //      session's pawn, not ours.  AcknowledgePossession would fail.
    //   3. PawnEmitter::emit_captured() now fires a clean native
    //      ClientRestart immediately after pkt#78 ships, with NetGUID 88
    //      bound to the captured pawn the client just registered.
    //
    // Sending the captured pkt#134 in addition to our native CR risks:
    //   - Duplicate ClientRestart triggers AcknowledgePossession twice
    //   - Malformed bytes cascade into surrounding bunches → CNSF
    //
    // Skip this packet.  If it turns out post-CR the client expects more
    // data from this position, we'll re-enable as Splice OR build native.

    // test, replay_loop emitted 148 packets in 22.7 s (≈153 ms/pkt avg
    // via adaptive 1-50ms tier pacing).  Our first attempt sent 478
    // packets in 10 s (≈20 ms/pkt) — 7.5× faster than baseline — and
    // produced flashing-then-reload symptoms (client can't keep up,
    // internal "still loading" timer fires, world resets).  Using
    // 50 ms here gives ~17.5 s for 350 extra rows, total bootstrap
    // window ≈22 s — comparable to the working hybrid baseline.
