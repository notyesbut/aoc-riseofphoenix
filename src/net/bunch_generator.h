// Phase D1 — pull-based bunch generator interface.
//
// A BunchGenerator is asked once per outbound tick whether it wants to emit
// a bunch on its assigned channel.  The generator is free to return
// std::nullopt (quiescent — generator does nothing this tick).  When it does
// return a bunch, the outbound builder is responsible for framing it (bunch
// header, packet header, sequence management) and sending it to the client.
//
// D1 scope intentionally keeps this interface tiny:
//   - One generator owns one channel index.
//   - The generator is invoked in the same thread/cadence as the replay
//     packet loop (one opportunity per replay packet iteration).
//   - No actor/object references — raw channel + raw payload bits only.
//   - No retransmission handling — D1 emits unreliable only.
//
// D2+ will extend this with:
//   - Reliable bunch support (ChSequence assignment, retransmission queue)
//   - Partial-multi-bunch support
//   - Richer TickContext (replica state, player position, world time)
//   - Multiple generators per channel (priority-ordered)
