// ============================================================================
//  protocol/emit/actor_builder.h
//
//  The schema-driven actor emitter.  Turns (ActorSchema + ActorRuntime)
//  into bunch bytes.
//
//  Three production methods:
//    - build_spawn:     full actor spawn bunch (for initial replication)
//    - build_delta:     property delta bunch (for periodic updates)
//    - build_destroy:   actor destroy bunch
//
//  Session C scope: build_spawn with byte-round-trip fidelity —
//  output must be re-parseable by our wire/packet_parser.
//
//  LAYER:  Protocol / emit
//  SESSION: C
