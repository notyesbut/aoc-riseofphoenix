//  protocol/net_guid_allocator.h
//
//  Server-side dynamic NetGUID allocator for multiplayer.
//
//  UE5 NetGUIDs are the client's stable reference to an actor/subobject.
//  For our live-server transition:
//
//    * STATIC NetGUIDs (class BPs, level, plugins) are SHARED across all
//      players.  They match what the client already has loaded from disk.
//      Hardcoded in the actor builders (e.g. Archetype=120, Level=10).
//
//    * DYNAMIC NetGUIDs (a player's PlayerController, Pawn, PlayerState,
//      AbilityComponent, etc.) are ALLOCATED PER-PLAYER by this class.
//      Each connecting player gets a unique block so their actors don't
//      collide with other players' actors.
//
//  Allocation scheme:
//    * kDynamicBase = 0x01000000 (16.7M) — well clear of captured NetGUIDs
//      which are in the low thousands range.
//    * Per-player block of kBlockSize = 256 GUIDs.  A player gets their
//      PC=base, Pawn=base+1, PlayerState=base+2, plus room for components.
//    * Up to (MaxPlayers) = (UINT32_MAX - kDynamicBase) / kBlockSize
//      ≈ 16 million players.  More than enough for any realistic server.
//
//  Thread-safety: the allocator is lock-free via std::atomic.  Multiple
//  GameServer threads can allocate concurrently without blocking.
//
//  Lifecycle:
//    * allocate_player_block() — called on player connect → returns the
//      base NetGUID for that player's block.
//    * release_player_block(base) — called on player disconnect.  Marks
//      the block as free for reuse.  In the MVP we just leak; reuse is
//      a TODO for long-running servers.
