//  Entry point for the "no-replay" bootstrap source.  In Phase 1 this reads
//  from an embedded byte array (generated from replay_data.bin by
//  tools/extract_bootstrap.py).  In Phase 3 it will orchestrate calls into
//  per-actor builders that synthesize packets from a CharacterProfile.
//
//  Integration strategy: populate the EXISTING ReplayData struct so the
//  rest of the GameServer code path stays unchanged.  This keeps the diff
//  small and makes the file/embedded switch invisible to downstream code.
